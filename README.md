**This is a development/experimental repository / stub.** 

Experimental feature for CEAMMC PureData library v0.7+
Check out the library itself:

## Converter from C++ class to PureData objects.

![screenshot](demo.png?raw=true "screenshot")

**Requires CEAMMC Pd v0.5+**

To build:
- put C++ files in (to_wrap) folder (doesn't scan subfolders).
- add sources to (to_include) and libraries to (to_link) folders.
- mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make
  
Python dependencies:  
pycairo, cppheaderparser, ply  

---
##### Features
  
- Plain types are converted to Pd atoms (float, symbols). Other types are converted to CEAMMC DataAtom.
- Converts plain functions to single Pd objects. Receives list with appropriate data or bang if function has no arguments. Outputs list or doesn't output anything if function return type is void. Second object outlet outputs pointer to function as DataAtom - this is queried by 'func' message sent to the object. 
- Converts classes with default constructors to Pd object that contains instance of that class and outputs it on bang. Outputs DataAtom.  
- Converts custom constructors of classes to "classname.new" objects. This object creates new instance of class when it receives appropriate list for initialization. Outputs DataAtom.  
- Converts class methods to single Pd objects. Objects derived from static class methods work as plain functions. Objects derived from non-static class methods require instance of class to be received as DataAtom.  
  
##### Current limitations
  
- Will not compile:
  * classes without copy/move constructors
  * unions in class or struct
  * variadic methods
  * constructors marked explicit
  * variadic functions
  * function-like macros
  * static functions with reference arguments
  
- Will skip:
  * template classes
  * all operators
  * enums

##### Todo list

- doc gen for methods with no-default-constructor classes
- doc gen depending on function signatures
- filter custom attributes
- classes without copy/move constructors
- tests
- convert STL containers <-> lists
- polymorphism
- enums

Tested in CEAMMC Pd 2018.03 (v0.5), CEAMMC Pd 2018.08 (v0.6)
